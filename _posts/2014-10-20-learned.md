I recently switched my primary file/directory browser plugin in Vim from [NERDTree][nerdtree] to [Vimfiler][vimfiler]. NERDTree is great. I have used it for a number of years and really do not have much to complain about. After a while of using Vimfiler I feel confident in saying that it is a superior tool. Here are a few reasons why I think Vimfiler is great.

First, the documentation is great (`:help vimfiler`). Not only that but the source is very readable, and I know very little about vimscript. Vimfiler has a ton of configuration options - which may seem like a negative thing when you are first just trying to get it working but once you are over that obstacle it is actually great. I will go over the configuration that I am using, but I will save that for the end. Here are a few neat things that Vimfiler does.

### Opening Vimfiler
![Opening Vimfiler][open]

This is the command that I use to toggle Vimfiler open/closed.

`:VimFilerExplorer -split -simple -parent -winwidth=35 -toggle -no-quit`

No, I do not type that every time, but I appreciate your concern. This is the mapping that I use:

`nnoremap <Leader>tr :<C-u>VimFilerExplorer -split -simple -parent -winwidth=35 -toggle -no-quit<CR>`

My `<Leader>` is set to the spacebar (`let mapleader=" "`)

You can also jump directly to a file's location in Vimfiler using this command:

`:VimFilerExplorer -split -simple -parent -winwidth=35 -no-quit -find`

Again, I prefer to map that to a shortcut rather than type that command each time, so I use the following:

`nnoremap <Leader>gr :<C-u>VimFilerExplorer -split -simple -parent -winwidth=35 -no-quit -find<CR>`

### Easy Help
![Help][help]

There are a lot of things available in Vimfiler's help menu which can be opened by pressing `g?`.

### Prompts for pane to open file in
![Prompt for Pane][pane-prompt]

Look closely at the bottom of the screen. When I press `Enter` on the file I wish to open I am prompted with `choose >` and each of my open panes gets a character at the bottom, either `s` or `d`. I press `s` when I want to open the file in the pane on the left and `d` when I want to open the file in the pane on the right. That is a pretty awesome feature.

### Easily toggle hidden files
![Toggle Hidden Files][toggle-hidden]

You can use `.` to toggle when Vimfiler will show/hide hidden files. By default all files that start with a `.` are considered 'hidden', this can be customized, which I will get into later when I go over my configuration.

### Easy to navigate directories
![Expand / Collapse Directories][expand]

You can also easily navigate directories by pressing `t` to expand a directory or `T` to recursively expand a directory.

### Changing directories
![Changing Directories in Vimfiler][cd]

Using the following mappings:

`autocmd FileType vimfiler nmap <buffer> l <Plug>(vimfiler_cd_or_edit)`
`autocmd FileType vimfiler nmap <buffer> h <Plug>(vimfiler_switch_to_parent_directory)`

I can use `h` to change the root of the project up one directory and `l` to change the root of the project into the directory under the cursor. When the cursor is placed over a file it will be opened.

### Easily change root directory
![Change Root Directory][change-root]

I put the keyboard on the screen for this one, but each keystroke happens pretty quickly. In Vimfiler you can press `\` to change the root directory of Vimfiler to the root of your file system. `~` will change to your home directory and `&` will change to your project directory (the 'project' directory being the directory that you were in when you opened Vim).

### Easily create new files and folders
![Create Files & Folders][create]

You can easily create new files using `N` and new folders using `K`. In addition to just creating files and folders you can create multiple at once by separating the names with `,`s. Also, when creating directories you can recursively create directories and create multiple nested directories by separating each new path to create with a `,`. You can create directories inside of other directories based on the position of your cursor in Vimfiler.

### Easy to rename files and folders
![Rename Files & Folders][rename]

I have [previouly written][renamer] about a vim plugin called `renamer.vim` which I no longer use because Vimfiler can do the same thing. You can select files and folders using `<Space>` and rename them using `r`.

### Actions on Existing Folders & Files

  * `d` to delete selected files(s) and folder(s)
  * `m` to move selected file(s) and folder(s)

### Configuration

Here is the configuration that I am using for vimfiler. You can learn more about each option by typing `:help vimfiler_ignore_pattern` for example.

{% highlight bash %}
let g:vimfiler_as_default_explorer = 1
let g:vimfiler_safe_mode_by_default = 0
let g:vimfiler_time_format = '%m-%d-%y %H:%M:%S'
let g:vimfiler_expand_jump_to_first_child = 0
let g:vimfiler_ignore_pattern = '\.git\|\.DS_Store\|\.pyc'
{% endhighlight %}

Here are some custom key mappings that I am using. These are not required, I just find them to be convenient.

{% highlight bash %}
nnoremap <Space>tr :<C-u>VimFilerExplorer -split -simple -parent -winwidth=35 -toggle -no-quit<CR>
nnoremap <Space>gr :<C-u>VimFilerExplorer -split -simple -parent -winwidth=35 -no-quit -find<CR>
autocmd FileType vimfiler nunmap <buffer> x
autocmd FileType vimfiler nmap <buffer> x <Plug>(vimfiler_toggle_mark_current_line)
autocmd FileType vimfiler vmap <buffer> x <Plug>(vimfiler_toggle_mark_selected_lines)
autocmd FileType vimfiler nunmap <buffer> l
autocmd FileType vimfiler nmap <buffer> l <Plug>(vimfiler_cd_or_edit)
autocmd FileType vimfiler nmap <buffer> h <Plug>(vimfiler_switch_to_parent_directory)
autocmd FileType vimfiler nmap <buffer> <C-R> <Plug>(vimfiler_redraw_screen)
autocmd FileType vimfiler nmap <silent><buffer><expr> <CR> vimfiler#smart_cursor_map(
\ "\<Plug>(vimfiler_expand_tree)",
\ "\<Plug>(vimfiler_edit_file)")
{% endhighlight %}

This is a snippet of code that I am using to install vimfiler. It depends on [unite][Unite], so you will need that as well. In this snippet I am using [neobundle][NeoBundle] to install everything.

{% highlight bash %}
if !1 | finish | endif
if has('vim_starting')
set nocompatible
set runtimepath+=~/.vim/bundle/neobundle.vim/
endif
let neobundle_readme=expand($HOME.'/.vim/bundle/neobundle.vim/README.md')
if !filereadable(neobundle_readme)
    silent !curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Shougo/neobundle.vim/master/bin/install.sh | sh
endif
call neobundle#begin(expand('~/.vim/bundle/'))
NeoBundleFetch 'Shougo/neobundle.vim'
NeoBundle 'Shougo/vimproc', {'build': {'mac': 'make -f make_mac.mak', 'unix': 'make -f make_unix.mak'}}
NeoBundle 'Shougo/unite.vim'
NeoBundle 'Shougo/vimfiler.vim'
call neobundle#end()
{% endhighlight %}

You may notice that [Shougo][shougo] is responsible for a lot of these things. Shougo is definitely a Vim wizard, so if you want to see some other great Vim stuff, checkout Shougo on github.
