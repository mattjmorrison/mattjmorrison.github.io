Alright, full disclosure, I did not learn this today but I did use it today and almost every other day, so I decided to write about it anyway. I use [Vim][vim] and [Tmux][tmux] (unfortunately, I am actually a bit embarrassed for both of those websites - remember they are great tools, with or without great websites). I also use splits in both. Moving around can be a bit tricky when you have one set of shortcuts to use when jumping between Tmux panes and a separate set of shortcuts to use when jumping between Vim panes.

By default moving your cursor from pane to pane in Vim uses `Control-w` (or `<C-w>`) followed by `h`, `j`, `k`, `l` to move left, down, up or right respectively. I find it simpler to use `Control` followed by `h`, `j`, `k` or `l`. That is a pretty simple thing to configure Vim to do:

{% highlight perl %}
nnoremap <C-j> <C-w>j
nnoremap <C-k> <C-w>k
nnoremap <C-h> <C-w>h
nnoremap <C-l> <C-w>l
{% endhighlight %}

That works great, however I want to take it to the next level. When I try to move down a pane and there are no more vim panes below my current pane but there is a tmux pane I want it to automatically jump down into the tmux pane. This is a bit more tricky, but can be handled with a function added to our `.vimrc` file and remapping our keys to use the function.


{% highlight perl %}
function! s:NavigateTermSplits(direction)
  let windowNumber = winnr()
  execute 'wincmd ' . a:direction
  if windowNumber == winnr()
    " We didn't move to a new vim split. Now try to move tmux splits
    silent call system('tmux select-pane -' . tr(a:direction, 'hjkl', 'LDUR'))
  endif
endfunction

nnoremap <silent> <C-h> :call <SID>NavigateTermSplits('h')<CR>
nnoremap <silent> <C-j> :call <SID>NavigateTermSplits('j')<CR>
nnoremap <silent> <C-k> :call <SID>NavigateTermSplits('k')<CR>
nnoremap <silent> <C-l> :call <SID>NavigateTermSplits('l')<CR>
{% endhighlight %}

In Tmux, moving your cursor between panes is different. The primary one I use is `<Leader>-o`. Unfortunately, that will just scroll your cursor from pane to pane counterclockwise one pane at a time, which is not quite as nice as moving left, down, up and right. The alternative is using `<Leader-q>`. `<Leader-q>` will display a number on each pane. Pressing one of the displayed numbers will move your cursor to that pane. That is fine, but I prefer to use something that works the same way as moving between Vim splits. Adding the following mappings in your `.tmux.conf` file will enable the same type of moving using `Control` followed by `h`, `j`, `k`, or `l` between tmux panes.

{% highlight perl %}
bind -n C-h select-pane -L
bind -n C-j select-pane -D
bind -n C-k select-pane -U
bind -n C-l select-pane -R
{% endhighlight %}

Again, that works great, however I want to take it to the next level. I want a smooth transition moving from tmux pane to vim pane and back.  Thanks to all of the hard work of [@JarrodCTaylor][jarrod] on the [dotfiles][dotfiles] (throw him a github star or six - he has earned it) it is possible to do just that. The last little bit of configuration to make it work goes in `.tmux.conf`.

{% highlight perl %}
is_view_vim_diff="echo '#{pane_current_command}' | grep -iqE '(view|vim)(diff)?'"
bind -n C-h run "$is_view_vim_diff && tmux send-keys C-h || tmux select-pane -L"
bind -n C-j run "$is_view_vim_diff && tmux send-keys C-j || tmux select-pane -D"
bind -n C-k run "$is_view_vim_diff && tmux send-keys C-k || tmux select-pane -U"
bind -n C-l run "$is_view_vim_diff && tmux send-keys C-l || tmux select-pane -R"
{% endhighlight %}

Here is a quick video of jumping around between Vim and Tmux splits interchangeably using only `Control` and `h`, `j`, `k` and `l`.
