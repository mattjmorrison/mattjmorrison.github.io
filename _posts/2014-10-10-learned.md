title: "Using CoffeeScript in Jekyll"

I use [Jekyll][jekyll] and [Github Pages][pages] for my blog. I also enjoy using [CoffeeScript][coffee]. Historically, using the two together was a bit tedious. It involved manually compiling your Coffee source into JavaScript and checking it into source control. That is a manual process, and as such it is not only bad but evil. In the current version of Jekyll that is used on [Github Pages][pages] CoffeeScript can be used with no manual processes, and quite easily as well.

As it turns out, it is very simple to use CoffeeScript with Jekyll. You simply create your `.coffee` file where you want your `.js` file to end up when your Jekyll site is generated. When you include the source into your `.html` file make sure you use the `.js` extension. For example, create the following file:

{% highlight bash %}
  assets/js/example.coffee
{% endhighlight %}

Then add the following to whichever html file needs your compiled coffeescript:

{% highlight html %}
  <script src="/assets/js/example.coffee"></script>
{% endhighlight %}

The only trick to it is that your coffeescript source file must contain a special bit of syntax to tell Jekyll that it needs to be transpiled. Make sure at the very top of your `.coffee` file(s) contain the following 2 lines:

{% highlight bash %}
  ---
---
{% endhighlight %}

That's it. Now just commit and push your code and Github Pages will take care of the rest.
