I discovered a useful vim plugin today called [renamer.vim][renamer]. From time to time I find myself in a situation where I have a bunch of files that I need to rename. Typically, I end up writing a script that will loop over a directory and apply some kind of crazy regular expression to rename every file in the directory. Well, no more! With `renamer.vim` I can use all of my vim skills to rename files just by manipulating a vim buffer, which is right in my wheel house. 

Here is a simple example of `renamer.vim` in action:
