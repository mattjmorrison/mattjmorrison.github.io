I like [bower][bower]. It certainly is not perfect, but it beats the alternative. I just recently discovered [bower-installer][bowerinstaller]. This takes bower to the next level. Bower, out of the box, will essentially just download your dependencies and throw them into a directory. It is still up to you to determine which files among those downloaded that you need to include in your application. Bower installer adds an additional step which does 'installation'.

I am using bower installer for this very blog. There are a few steps involved which I walk walk through.

### Step 1: define your bower dependencies

Create a `bower.json` file that contains your bower dependencies:
{% highlight javascript %}
{
    "name": "mattjmorrison.com",
    "dependencies": {
        "ember": "1.7.0"
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}


### Step 2: install bower-installer and your bower dependencies

Create a `package.json` file that looks something like this:
{% highlight javascript %}
{
    "name": "mattjmorrison.com",
    "dependencies": {
        "bower-installer": "*"
    },
    "scripts": {
        "postinstall": "bower-installer"
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Then running `npm install` will install `bower-installer` as well as your bower dependencies.

At this point bower has done the normal process of just downloading everything. After running `npm install` there will be a directory called `bower_components` that looks something like this:

```
bower_components
 |-- ember
 |    +-- ( all ember files here )
 |-- handlebars
 |    +-- ( all handlebars files here )
 +-- jquery
      +-- ( all jquery files here )
```

### Step 3: 'Install' the bower dependencies, rather than just download

The next step involves us modifying our `bower.json` file to tell it where to install the files.

{% highlight javascript %}
{
    "name": "mattjmorrison.com",
    "dependencies": {
        "ember": "1.7.0"
    },
    "install": {
        "path": {
            "js": "assets/js/lib/",
        }
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

With this new configuration it will take the `main` script defined in each bower dependeny's `bower.json` file and install it to the path specified in your `bower.json` file. With this configuration you will still have a `bower_components` directory (which should be ignored by source control) but you will also get an `assets/js/lib` directry which should just be the files that you need. In my scenario it looks something like this:

```
assets
 +-- js
      +-- lib
           |-- ember
           |    +-- ember.js
           |-- handlebars
           |    +-- handlebars.js
           +-- jquery
                +-- jquery.js
```

This is much better than just having a huge dump of all of the files that come along with each of those frameworks. In my scenario for this blog I have my `assets` directory under source control. I can easily update my dependency versions by running `npm install` again after updating the versions that I need in `bower.json`.
