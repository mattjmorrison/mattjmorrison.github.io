Agile development is something that I've never really done professionally, but
I really want to be in that space. Implementing agile practices to an
organization that is not agile is not an easy thing to do. There will be
resistance from every angle, BAs, QAs, developers, managers, etc. This morning,
I had an experience that helped to clarify in my mind why agile techniques can
be hard to adopt. My experience made me realize that by nature people favor
process and ceremony over results. While most people are geared towards end
results, intermediate results don't seem to matter much as long as the standard
process and ceremonies are followed.

The experience that made the "bulb over my head" turn on was a very simple
example how, without even thinking, I followed a process and ceremony with the
end desired result in mind but ignoring the intermediate results. This morning,
I walked into the bathroom and reached for the light switch. I moved my hand in
the usual upward motion over the switch and made contact but didn't feel the
typical "flip" and didn't hear the typical "click" of the switch being turned
to the on position.

Following my usual ceremony and procedure, I tried again. Again, I made contact
with the switch but the switch didn't flip and I didn't hear the comforting
ceremonial "click" of the switch being flipped. It was at this point that I
realized that while my intention of reaching the end result of having the lights
turned on was completely distracted by my typical ceremony and process of
flipping the light switch. In that same moment, I realized that the switch was
already in the on position, and the lights were already on. I just needed to
wake up and realize that the end result was already attained and I didn't need
to follow my typical process twice, once or even at all.

Process and ceremony are hard things to bread once we get comfortable, but in
some cases they overstay their welcome and usefulness. I could have walked into
that room and gone about my business, but instead my typical ceremony got in my
way and slowed me down.

Stay tuned for part one of a new blog post series that I'm going to start called
"My Crusade for Agility".
