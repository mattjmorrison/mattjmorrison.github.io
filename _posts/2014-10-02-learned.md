Alright, full disclosure, I did not learn this today but I did use it today and almost every other day, so I decided to write about it anyway. I use [Vim][vim] and [Tmux][tmux] (unfortunately, I am actually a bit embarrassed for both of those websites - remember they are great tools, with or without great websites). I also use splits in both. Moving around can be a bit tricky when you have one set of shortcuts to use when jumping between Tmux panes and a separate set of shortcuts to use when jumping between Vim panes.

By default moving your cursor from pane to pane in Vim uses `Control-w` (or `<C-w>`) followed by `h`, `j`, `k`, `l` to move left, down, up or right respectively. I find it simpler to use `Control` followed by `h`, `j`, `k` or `l`. That is a pretty simple thing to configure Vim to do:

{% highlight perl %}
nnoremap <C-j> <C-w>j
nnoremap <C-k> <C-w>k
nnoremap <C-h> <C-w>h
nnoremap <C-l> <C-w>l
{% endhighlight %}

In Tmux, moving your cursor between panes is different. The primary one I use is `<Leader>-o`. Unfortunately, that will just scroll your cursor from pane to pane counterclockwise one pane at a time, which is not quite as nice as moving left, down, up and right. The alternative is using `<Leader-q>`. `<Leader-q>` will display a number on each pane. Pressing one of the displayed numbers will move your cursor to that pane. That is fine, but I prefer to use something that works the same way as moving between Vim splits. Thanks to all of the hard work of [@JarrodCTaylor][jarrod] on the [dotfiles][dotfiles] (throw him a github star or six - he has earned it) it is possible to use the exact same keys to jump from Tmux pane to Vim pane and back again.

There is a bit of configuration to add to your `.tmux.conf` file to get this to work.

{% highlight perl %}
bind -n C-h run "(tmux display-message -p '#{pane_current_command}' | grep -iqE '(^|\/)vim(diff)?$' && tmux send-keys C-h) || tmux select-pane -L"
bind -n C-j run "(tmux display-message -p '#{pane_current_command}' | grep -iqE '(^|\/)vim(diff)?$' && tmux send-keys C-j) || tmux select-pane -D"
bind -n C-k run "(tmux display-message -p '#{pane_current_command}' | grep -iqE '(^|\/)vim(diff)?$' && tmux send-keys C-k) || tmux select-pane -U"
bind -n C-l run "(tmux display-message -p '#{pane_current_command}' | grep -iqE '(^|\/)vim(diff)?$' && tmux send-keys C-l) || tmux select-pane -R"
{% endhighlight %}

Here is a quick video of jumping around between Vim and Tmux splits interchangeably using only `Control` and `h`, `j`, `k` and `l`.
