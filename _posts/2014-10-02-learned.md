Today I was talking to some members of my team about [pomodoro][pomodoro], [ping-pong pairing][pingpong] and ping-pong pomodoro (which is where the driver would switch after a given time limit). One suggestion was to automate the driver switching, like an automatic chess clock. I thought that was an interesting idea so I did a quick experiment with `tmux`. 

I was able to use the command `tmux switch-client -c $CLIENTID -r`, where `$CLIENTID` would be the `tmux` client name, to toggle `tmux` clients in and out of read only mode. I did a [quick spike][spike] to see if I could toggle it so that only one person could drive at a time while the other could only watch. It seems to be possible, so that might be something I actually flush out into a fully functional plugin.

Here is a demo of what my proof-of-concept looked like:
