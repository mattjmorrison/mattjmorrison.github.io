I recently purchased a Mac Book...which is the first non-windows computer that
I've ever purchased. I can honestly say that I couldn't be happier. I've never
before had the pleasure of using a more user-friendly OS. I only wish that I
would have been using a mac for years. As a developer, I consider myself a super
user...and the more work the computer will do for me, the more productive I can
be at my job. Using Windows, I consider myself super productive...I can only
imagine how productive I can be on my new Mac...if easy things (like installing
applications) is so much easier on a Mac than on Windows, I can only imagine how
much easier the really hard stuff is going to be.

I'm still just getting into it, but I'll be sure to post updates about my Mac
journey.

I'm very excited to do some hard core development and see how it goes.
