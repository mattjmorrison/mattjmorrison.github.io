Last night I presented a high level look at running the Django web
framework on Jython at the Central Iowa Java Users Group. I posted
all of my code examples and slides on github. If you have any follow
up questions, comments or corrections I'd like to hear from you, so
drop me a line. Thanks to everyone who was able to make it, I hope
you enjoyed my presentation.
