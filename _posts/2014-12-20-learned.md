This is a very cool little thing that I learned recently. In Vim, when you are visually selecting text you can sometimes get caught in a situation where you need to continue to highlight text both before and after what you already have highlighted. Luckily, Vim provides a way to move your cursor from where the beginning of the highlighted text to the end of it. To do this press `o` when you are in visual mode. Here is an example of using this feature in action.
