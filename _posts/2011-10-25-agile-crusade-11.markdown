Welcome to the 11th installment of My Crusade for Agility. In my ten previous
posts I've discussed just about everything I can think of relating to championing
agile adoption at my place of employment. This is a very exciting installment
because we just finished our first development sprint. We definitely have room
for improvement. This week was a very unfortunate week to be ending a sprint, and
maybe last week was an equally bad week to start one for lots of reasons.


The reason that this was an unfortunate timing for a first sprint is because:
* We just got new hardware, so there was downtime setting that up.
* I am taking vacation for the second half of the sprint, so we will be
short-handed.
* We are getting a new team member this week, so there will be some training and
whatnot involved with bringing them onboard.
* One of the first issues that I noticed with this sprint was that we "finished"
all of our stories on the 7th day of a 10 day sprint. So our planning was off and
we ended up without enough work to do... or did we? The reason that I say,
"or did we?" is because of the second issue. The second issue is that besides the
story and task cards we didn't have any acceptance criteria or acceptance tests
so as we "completed" most of the stories they seemed to drag on and we continued
to code even though the card's criteria was fulfilled. That seems like it could
get dangerous because we, the developers, start to make assumptions about how
things should work. Another issue is that now that all of the code is written,
unit tested and deployed to staging it has not been QA tested.

QA testing is a very important thing that needs to happen. Since we finished the
development work with 2 days left we, the developers, could take off our
developer hats and put on QA tester hats, however developers don't make good QAs.
I say that because if I write some code, then QA test that same code there is a
good chance that I am going to be aware of the brittle bits and intentionally
avoid them. The whole "switching hats" idea that I mentioned before starts to
seem pretty waterfall-ish. We do not currently have a dedicated QA testing team
member, hopefully we will one day.

I think our biggest issue that needs to be resolved, at this point, is our broken
feedback loop between completing development and QA testing. The reason that loop
is broken is pretty obviously a gap in staffing. There just isn't anyone at our
disposal who can dedicate their time to quality assurance. Unfortunately, adding
to staff is completely out of my control (not a responsibility that I want, btw).

Finally, because I'm going on vacation our retrospective is probably going to be
delayed. I think it would be ideal to deliver all of the QA tested and
signed-off-on changes sometime on the 9th day of the sprint, have the retro
meeting that afternoon or on the morning of the final day then demo everything on
the final day. That, unfortunately, is not going to work out this time (for me at
least - maybe this is something that the rest of the team will do while I'm gone).


At the end of the day, and the end of this post, I think sprints are going to be
a huge win for my team. Adding a full time QA team member would help improve our
process significantly, but in the meantime there are plenty of things that we can
improve. I plan to write more about our first sprint after we have discussed it
as a team, so tune in next time for the 12th edition of My Crusade for Agility.
