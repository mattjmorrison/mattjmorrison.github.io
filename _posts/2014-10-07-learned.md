I ran into a situation today where I wanted to align some columns of text. It was some fairly minimal css that looked something like this:

{% highlight css %}
.something { height: 100px; width: 100px; }
.another { position: absolute; }
.last-one { font-size: 10pt; }
{% endhighlight %}

I used the [EasyAlign][easyalign] plugin to line things up on the `{` and `}` characters. After installing EasyAlign (I will let you figure that one out on your own) I added the following key mapping in my `.vimrc` file:

{% highlight perl %}
vmap <Enter> <Plug>(EasyAlign)
{% endhighlight %}

Now, I am able to visually select the rows that I want to align, press `Enter` and type a `{`. That will align everything to look like this:

{% highlight css %}
.something { height: 100px; width: 100px; }
.another   { position: absolute; }
.last-one  { font-size: 10pt; }
{% endhighlight %}

Now, if I want to also align the `}`s I can visually select those rows again and type `Enter` followed by `}` which will produce the following:

{% highlight css %}
.something { height: 100px; width: 100px; }
.another   { position: absolute;          }
.last-one  { font-size: 10pt;             }
{% endhighlight %}

The EasyAlign plugin is capable of a whole lot more than that, it is worth checking out.
