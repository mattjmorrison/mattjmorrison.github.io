I have experienced a lot of pain with npm modules over the past year or so. I would largely attribute my pain to three main things:

- The number of modules
- The number of dependencies per module
- The frequency at which modules change

Today, I was listening to [JavaScript Jabber][jsj] episode [127][127] and they mentioned a feature of npm of which I was not aware, but is a total game changer. The npm command [shrinkwrap][shrinkwrap] will create a file called `npm-shrinkwrap.json` which will 'lock-in' every version of every one of your npm dependencies as well as your dependencies' dependencies and so on down the chain. When you have an `npm-shrinkwrap.json` file in addition to your `package.json` file an `npm install` will use the dependencies listed in `npm-shrinkwrap.json` instead of re-resolving the whole dependency tree again based on your `package.json` file as well as the `package.json` file for all of your dependencies and their dependencies.

This is a great feature, I wish I would have known about it a year ago. This will definitely help resolve a lot of issues for me personally.
